# Book rating prediction project

### Background

Nowadays with so many books available, it can be hard to select the best ones to read. The dataset provided is a curation of Goodreads books based on real user information. It can be
used for many tasks like predicting a book’s rating or recommending new books.
Below is the information you have regarding the dataset attributes:
        1) bookID: A unique identification number for each book.
        2) title: The name under which the book was published.
        3) authors: The names of the authors of the book. Multiple authors are delimited by “/”.
        4) average_rating: The average rating of the book received in total.
        5) isbn: Another unique number to identify the book, known as the International
        Standard Book Number.
        6) isbn13: A 13-digit ISBN to identify the book, instead of the standard 11-digit ISBN.
        7) language_code: Indicates the primary language of the book. For instance, “eng” is
        standard for English.
        8) num_pages: The number of pages the book contains.
        9) ratings_count: The total number of ratings the book received.
        10) text_reviews_count: The total number of written text reviews the book received.

        12) publisher: The name of the book publisher.

### Objectives

Using the provided dataset, we want to build and to train a model that predicts a book’s rating. The
project include exploratory analysis of the data, feature engineering and selection, model training and evaluation and
finally, deployment.
